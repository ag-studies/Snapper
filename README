Snapper is a command-line utility that sniffs your local network for active
TCP connections (only those with PSH/ACK flags set) and then sends RST
(reset) packets to terminate those connections (using RAW sockets).
Therefore "snapper" is a program that generates a single packet DoS attack.
It is written as a proof-of-concept for a "Protocol Design" class at Aalto
University.


Sending spurious RST Packets can be used for malicious purposes (e.g., DoS
attack [1]) or closing down suspicious connections. In recent years, it has
been used by ISPs to close down P2P connections (e.g., by Comcast:
